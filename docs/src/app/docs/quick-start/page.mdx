# Quick Start

Get Chloe running in your project in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Pro/Max subscription](https://claude.ai/upgrade)
- Claude Code CLI - `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- A project directory where you want to use Chloe

## Installation

<Tabs items={['One-Line Install', 'Build from Source']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    The fastest way to get started:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL getchloe.sh/install | bash
    ```

    This downloads the latest release and installs it to your path.
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    If you prefer to build from source, you'll need [Rust 1.70+](https://rustup.rs) installed:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KevinEdry/chloe.git
    cd chloe
    cargo build --release --locked
    ```

    The binary will be at `target/release/chloe`. Move it to a directory in your PATH:

    ```bash
    cp target/release/chloe ~/.local/bin/
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Starting Your First Session

<Steps>
### Initialize Your Project

Navigate to your project directory and initialize Chloe:

```bash
cd your-project
chloe init
```

This creates a `.chloe/` directory to store your tasks and configurations. The directory is automatically added to `.gitignore`.

### Launch Chloe

Start Chloe:

```bash
chloe
```

You'll see the main interface with four tabs:
- **Tasks** - Your Kanban board
- **Instances** - Terminal panes
- **Roadmap** - Project planning
- **Worktree** - Git worktree management

### Create Your First Task

1. Press `a` to add a new task
2. Type your task description
3. Press `Enter` to save

The task appears in the "To Do" column.

### Open a Terminal Instance

1. Press `2` to switch to the Instances tab
2. Press `c` to create a new terminal pane
3. Start Claude Code or any other command

### Link Task to Instance

1. Press `1` to go back to Tasks
2. Navigate to your task with `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` or arrow keys
3. Press `Enter` to move it to "In Progress"
4. The task is now linked to your active instance
</Steps>

## Data Storage

Chloe stores all state in `.chloe/state.json` in your project directory:

- Tasks and their statuses
- Instance configurations
- Roadmap items
- View settings
