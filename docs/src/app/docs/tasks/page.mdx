# Tasks

The Tasks tab is the primary workflow hub of Chloe, managing your work through a Kanban-based system with four columns.

![Tasks Focus View](/docs/tasks-view-toggle.gif)

## Columns

Tasks flow through four columns representing their lifecycle:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Planning** | Backlog for new tasks waiting to be started |
| **In Progress** | Active work with linked terminal instances |
| **Review** | Completed work awaiting your approval |
| **Done** | Finished tasks (persistent archive) |

## View Modes

Toggle between views with the `/` key.

### Focus View (Default)

The focus view shows your active tasks in a list format with a details panel on the right.


- **Left panel**: Active tasks (Planning + In Progress)
- **Right panel**: Selected task details
- **Bottom section**: Completed tasks

### Kanban View

The Kanban view displays all four columns visually, similar to a traditional Kanban board.


## Task Types

Each task has a type displayed as a colored badge:

| Type | Color | Use Case |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Feature** | Purple | New functionality |
| **Bug** | Red | Something broken |
| **Chore** | Gray | Maintenance work |
| **Task** | Blue | General tasks |

<Callout type="info">
When creating a task, Chloe can use AI to automatically classify the task type based on its title and description.
</Callout>

## Creating Tasks

<Steps>
### Press `a` to add a new task

A text input appears at the bottom of the screen.

Be descriptive - this will be sent to Claude when the task starts.

### Press Enter to save

The task appears in the Planning column.
</Steps>

## Starting a Task

When you're ready to work on a task:

1. Navigate to the task in the Planning column
2. Press `s` to start the task

This automatically:
- Moves the task to In Progress
- Creates a new terminal instance
- Sends your task to Claude Code with the prompt:
  ```
  Work on this task:

  Title: [your task title]

  Description: [your task description]
  ```

## Terminal Focus Mode

When a task is In Progress, press `Enter` to enter Terminal Focus Mode:

- All keyboard input goes directly to the terminal
- Watch Claude work on your task in real-time
- Press `Esc` to exit and return to task navigation

## Review Workflow

When Claude completes a task, it automatically moves to the Review column. Press `Enter` on a review task to see your options:


| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Review in IDE** | Opens the changed files in your configured IDE |
| **Review in Terminal** | Opens a terminal at the worktree location |
| **Request Changes** | Send feedback to Claude for revisions |
| **Merge to Branch** | Merge the worktree changes to your main branch |

<Callout type="warning">
If merge conflicts are detected, the "Merge to Branch" option changes to "Resolve Conflicts" and Claude will be prompted to fix them.
</Callout>
