# Overview

Chloe is a terminal UI application for orchestrating AI coding agents with integrated task and terminal management. It works with Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Amp, OpenCode, and any terminal-based AI tool. It brings together task tracking, multiple terminal sessions, and project planning in a single, keyboard-driven interface.

## Why Use Chloe?

Managing multiple AI coding agent sessions can quickly become chaotic. Chloe solves this by providing:

- **Multi-Provider Support**: Works with Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Amp, OpenCode, and more
- **Unified Interface**: See all your tasks, terminals, and roadmap items in one place
- **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple AI agents side-by-side without tab switching
- **Task Tracking**: Built-in Kanban board to track what each instance is working on
- **Keyboard-First**: Navigate everything without touching your mouse
- **Persistent State**: Your tasks and configurations survive restarts
