# Overview

Chloe is a terminal UI application for orchestrating parallel Claude Code instances with integrated task and terminal management. It brings together task tracking, multiple terminal sessions, and project planning in a single, keyboard-driven interface.

## Why Use Chloe?

Managing multiple Claude Code sessions can quickly become chaotic. Chloe solves this by providing:

- **Unified Interface**: See all your tasks, terminals, and roadmap items in one place
- **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple Claude Code instances side-by-side without tab switching
- **Task Tracking**: Built-in Kanban board to track what each instance is working on
- **Keyboard-First**: Navigate everything without touching your mouse
- **Persistent State**: Your tasks and configurations survive restarts
