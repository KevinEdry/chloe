# Common Workflows

Practical patterns for getting the most out of Chloe.

## Running Multiple Claude Code Instances

<Callout type="info">
  This is the primary use case for Chloe — orchestrating multiple Claude Code sessions working on different parts of your project.
</Callout>

<Steps>
### Create tasks for each piece of work

- Press `1` to go to Tasks
- Press `a` to add tasks for each feature/bug you want to work on

### Open multiple terminal instances

- Press `2` to go to Instances
- Press `c` multiple times to create panes (2-4 is typical)

### Start Claude Code in each pane

- Press `Enter` to focus a pane
- Run `claude` to start Claude Code
- Press `Esc` to exit focus mode
- Repeat for each pane

### Link tasks to instances

- Press `1` to go to Tasks
- Navigate to a task and press `Enter` to move it to "In Progress"
- Press `t` to jump to the linked instance
</Steps>

### Managing Progress

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| Check status | Press `1` to see all tasks organized by status |
| Switch context | Press `t` on any task to jump to its terminal |
| Complete work | Move tasks to "Done" with `Enter` when finished |
| Review | Press `Enter` on completed tasks to review the work |

## Feature Development Workflow

When working on a new feature across multiple sessions:

### Day 1: Planning

**Add roadmap items**
- Press `3` to go to Roadmap
- Press `a` to add high-level milestones
- Use `p` to set priorities

**Break down into tasks**
- Press `t` on roadmap items to convert them to tasks
- Tasks appear in your Kanban board

### Day 2+: Execution

**Pick up where you left off**
- Run `chloe` - your state is preserved
- Check "In Progress" column for active work

**Work in parallel**
- Different Claude instances can work on different tasks
- Use the task board to track what each is doing

<Callout>
  **Handling blockers**: Move blocked tasks back to "To Do" with `Backspace` and add notes by editing the task with `e`.
</Callout>

## Git Worktree Workflow

For working on multiple branches simultaneously:

<Steps>
### View existing worktrees

- Press `4` to go to Worktree view
- See all active worktrees

### Open worktree in new environment

- Navigate to a worktree
- Press `o` to open it in your IDE and terminal

### Link to tasks

- Each worktree can have its own Chloe instance
- Run `chloe init` in the worktree directory
</Steps>

### Parallel Feature Development

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Main branch** | Bug fixes and urgent work |
| **Feature branch A** | New feature development |
| **Feature branch B** | Refactoring work |

Each worktree gets its own terminal panes and task tracking.

## Quick Task Triage

<Callout type="info" emoji="⚡">
  When you have many tasks to organize, use Focus view for rapid triage.
</Callout>

<Steps>
### Switch to Focus view

Press `/` in Tasks view to toggle Focus mode and see all tasks in a single column.

### Rapid prioritization

- Use `j`/`k` to quickly navigate
- Press `Enter` to move tasks forward
- Press `Backspace` to move tasks back

### Return to Kanban

Press `/` again to see the organized board.
</Steps>

## AI-Assisted Roadmap Generation

<Steps>
### Go to Roadmap view

Press `3`

### Generate suggestions

- Press `g`
- Chloe analyzes your project and suggests roadmap items

### Curate the results

- Edit suggestions with `e`
- Delete unwanted items with `d`
- Convert good items to tasks with `t`
</Steps>

## Keyboard Efficiency Tips

<Callout type="info" emoji="⌨️">
  Master these patterns to navigate Chloe like a pro.
</Callout>

| Tip | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Quick View Switching** | Use number keys (`1`, `2`, `3`, `4`) instead of `Tab` for instant access |
| **Vim Muscle Memory** | `hjkl` navigation works everywhere — left, down, up, right |
| **Jump to Extremes** | `g` goes to first item, `G` to last item in any list |

### Focus Mode Tips

<Callout>
  When working in a terminal pane:
  1. Press `Enter` to focus (sends keystrokes to terminal)
  2. Do your work in Claude Code
  3. Press `Esc` to exit focus and navigate elsewhere
  4. Use `2` to return to Instances view if needed
</Callout>

### Quick Context Switching

| From | To | How |
|------|-----|-----|
| Any task | Its terminal | Press `t` |
| Any terminal | All tasks | Press `1` |
| Anywhere | Any view | Press number keys |
