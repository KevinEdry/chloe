While fetching data from GitHub, a loading spinner is displayed. If the API request fails, an error message shows what went wrong.

<Callout type="info">
The GitHub API has rate limits. If you see rate limit errors, wait a few minutes before refreshing.
</Callout>

- A repository with a GitHub remote
- Network access to GitHub
- Appropriate permissions to view PRs
