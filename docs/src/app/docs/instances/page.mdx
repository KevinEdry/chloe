# Instances

The Instances tab manages your terminal panes - PTY (pseudo-terminal) sessions that can run independently or be linked to tasks.

## Layout Modes

Chloe supports multiple layout configurations for your terminal panes:

| Layout | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Single** | One pane full screen |
| **Horizontal Split** | Two panes stacked vertically |
| **Vertical Split** | Two panes side-by-side |
| **Grid** | Four panes in a 2x2 grid |


## Creating Panes

Press `c` to create a new terminal pane. This spawns a new shell session in your project directory.

<Callout type="info">
Panes created from tasks automatically start Claude Code with your task description.
</Callout>

## Navigation Modes

### Normal Mode

In Normal mode, you navigate between panes without sending input to the terminal.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `←` / `↑` | Select previous pane |
| `→` / `↓` | Select next pane |
| `Enter` | Enter Focused mode |
| `c` | Create new pane |
| `x` | Close current pane |

The selected pane has a highlighted border.


### Focused Mode

Press `Enter` to enter Focused mode on the selected pane. In this mode:

- All keyboard input goes directly to the terminal
- You can type commands, interact with Claude, etc.
- Press `Esc` to exit and return to Normal mode

## Scrollback Navigation

While in Focused mode, you can navigate the terminal's scrollback buffer:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Shift+PageUp` | Scroll up through history |
| `Shift+PageDown` | Scroll down through history |
| `Shift+Home` | Jump to top of scrollback |
| `Shift+End` | Jump to latest output |

<Callout>
The scrollback buffer preserves the full terminal history, so you can review Claude's previous output even after it scrolls off screen.
</Callout>

## Claude State Indicators

Each instance tracks Claude's current state:

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Idle** | Terminal waiting for input |
| **Running** | Claude is actively working |
| **Needs Permissions** | Claude is waiting for approval |
| **Done** | Claude has completed the task |


## Task Integration

When you start a task from the Tasks tab:

1. A new terminal instance is created automatically
2. Claude Code is launched with your task description
3. The task and instance are linked by ID
4. Press `t` in the Tasks tab to jump to the linked instance

When Claude signals completion, the linked task automatically moves to the Review column.

## Mouse Support

Chloe supports mouse interaction in the Instances tab:

- **Click** on a pane to select it
- **Scroll wheel** works for terminal scrollback

## Technical Details

- **Terminal Emulation**: VT100 parsing for escape sequences
- **PTY Backend**: Cross-platform pseudo-terminal support
- **Real-time Output**: Terminal polled every render cycle
- **No Persistence**: Live sessions don't survive app restart (only working directory is saved)
