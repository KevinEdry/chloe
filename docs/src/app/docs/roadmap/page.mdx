# Roadmap

The Roadmap tab is for strategic planning - high-level features and initiatives that break down into individual tasks.

## Roadmap Items

Each roadmap item represents a larger feature or initiative:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Title** | Feature or initiative name |
| **Description** | What it does |
| **Rationale** | Why it's important |
| **User Stories** | List of use cases |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | Definition of done |
| **Status** | Planned, In Progress, Completed, Cancelled |
| **Priority** | High, Medium, or Low |
| **Dependencies** | Links to other roadmap items |
| **Tags** | Categorization labels |

## Priority Levels

Items are sorted by priority and displayed with color indicators:

| Priority | Color | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **High** | Red | Critical path, do first |
| **Medium** | Yellow | Important but not blocking |
| **Low** | Gray | Nice to have, backlog |

## Creating Roadmap Items

Press `a` to add a new roadmap item:

1. Enter the title
2. Press `Enter` to save
3. The item appears with Medium priority by default


## AI Generation

Press `g` or `G` to generate a roadmap using AI:

1. Chloe analyzes your project
2. AI suggests features and improvements
3. Items are created with appropriate priorities

<Callout type="info">
AI generation examines your codebase structure, existing features, and common patterns to suggest relevant roadmap items.
</Callout>

## Converting to Tasks

When you're ready to work on a roadmap item:

1. Select the item with `j`/`k`
2. Press `t` to convert to a task
3. The item becomes a task in the Tasks tab

This creates a direct link between your strategic planning and day-to-day execution.

## Managing Items

### Edit

Press `e` to edit the selected item's title.

### Delete

Press `d` to delete an item (requires confirmation with `y`/`n`).

### Change Priority

Press `p` to cycle through priorities:

```
High → Medium → Low → High
```

## Keybindings

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `↓` | Select next item |
| `k` / `↑` | Select previous item |
| `a` | Add new item |
| `e` | Edit item title |
| `d` | Delete item |
| `t` | Convert to task |
| `p` | Cycle priority |
| `g` / `G` | Generate roadmap with AI |

## Status Workflow

Roadmap items have four possible statuses:

```
Planned → In Progress → Completed
                    ↘ Cancelled
```

- **Planned**: Not yet started
- **In Progress**: Active development
- **Completed**: Done and shipped
- **Cancelled**: Decided not to pursue

## Dependencies

Roadmap items can depend on other items. Dependencies are tracked by ID and displayed in the item details.

<Callout type="warning">
Dependencies help you understand the order of work, but Chloe doesn't enforce them - you can start any item regardless of dependency status.
</Callout>

## Persistence

All roadmap data is saved to your project's `.chloe/state.json` file and survives app restarts.
