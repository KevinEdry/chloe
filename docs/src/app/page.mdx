# Chloe

Terminal UI for orchestrating parallel Claude Code instances with integrated task and terminal management.

## What is Chloe?

Chloe (a wordplay on "Claude TUI") is a terminal-based task management application built with Rust. It combines a kanban board for tracking work with integrated terminal instances, letting you manage multiple Claude Code sessions in parallel while maintaining visibility and control over what each instance is doing.

## Features

- **Task Management** - Kanban board and task list views with To Do, In Progress, and Done states
- **Interactive Instances** - Multiple terminal panes with full PTY support
- **Roadmap View** - Visualize project milestones and plan work across time
- **Worktrees** - Manage git worktrees for parallel development on multiple branches
