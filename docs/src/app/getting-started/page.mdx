# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ (2024 edition)

## Installation

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KevinEdry/chloe.git
cd chloe
cargo build --release --locked
```

The binary will be at `target/release/chloe`.

### Initialize a Project

Before using Chloe in a project, initialize it:

```bash
chloe init
```

This creates a `.chloe/` directory in your project and adds it to `.gitignore`.

## Running Chloe

Simply run the binary:

```bash
chloe
```

Or if you haven't added it to your PATH:

```bash
./target/release/chloe
```

## Data Storage

State is stored in `.chloe/state.json` in your project directory, including:
- Tasks and their statuses
- Instance configurations
- Roadmap items
- Settings
