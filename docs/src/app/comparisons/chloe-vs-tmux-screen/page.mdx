## When to Choose Chloe

### Best For AI Coding Workflows

Chloe is purpose-built for AI coding agents. If you regularly use:

- **Claude Code** from Anthropic
- **OpenCode**
- **Gemini CLI** from Google
- **Amp** or other AI assistants

Chloe automatically detects these tools and provides:
- Parallel agent execution
- Visual task management
- Git worktree integration
- Workspace awareness

### Built-in Task Management

Unlike tmux/screen, Chloe includes a Kanban board that lets you:
- Organize work into To Do, In Progress, and Done columns
- Link terminals to specific tasks
- Track progress visually without context switching
- Persist task state across sessions

### Easier to Learn

Chloe uses **vim-style navigation** (`hjkl` keys), making it instantly familiar to developers who know Vim. No complex prefix keys to memorize.

**tmux equivalent:**
```bash
# tmux requires learning prefix key combinations
Ctrl+b %    # Split vertically
Ctrl+b "    # Split horizontally
Ctrl+b o    # Switch panes
```

**Chloe approach:**
```bash
# Simple, intuitive key bindings
s          # Split panes
hjkl       # Navigate between panes
n          # New task
```

### First-Class Worktree Support

Working on multiple branches simultaneously? Chloe makes **Git worktrees** and **Jujutsu workspaces** first-class citizens:

- Automatic worktree detection
- Per-task worktree assignment
- Visual indicator of which branch each terminal is on
- Seamless switching between workspaces

With tmux/screen, you manually manage worktrees and remember which terminal is in which branch.

## When to Choose tmux

### Already Have a Complex Configuration

If you've invested years into a custom `.tmux.conf` with:
- Custom key bindings
- Plugin ecosystem (tmux-resurrect, tmux-continuum, etc.)
- Integration with other tools
- Team-wide standardization

**Stick with tmux.** Your productivity optimizations are valuable.

### Need Maximum Compatibility

tmux has been around since 2007 and is available on virtually every Unix-like system. If you:
- Work on legacy systems
- Need guaranteed availability across servers
- Have strict IT policies about installed tools

**tmux is the safer choice.**

### Minimal Resource Usage

tmux uses slightly less memory than Chloe (~2MB vs ~5MB). For resource-constrained environments like:
- Embedded systems
- Minimal containers
- Systems with <100MB RAM

**tmux or screen will be lighter.**

## When to Choose screen

### Legacy Environment Requirements

GNU Screen (1987) is even more ubiquitous than tmux. Choose screen if:
- You work on ancient Unix systems
- tmux isn't available and you can't install it
- You need compatibility with very old scripts

### You're Already a Power User

If you've mastered screen's escape sequences and have muscle memory built up, there's no compelling reason to switch unless you're adopting AI coding workflows.

## Migration from tmux/screen to Chloe

### What You'll Gain

1. **No more manual session management** - Chloe auto-saves your workspace
2. **Visual task tracking** - See what you're working on at a glance
3. **AI agent awareness** - Automatic configuration for Claude Code, OpenCode, etc.
4. **Simpler keybindings** - Vim-style navigation you already know

### What You'll Miss

1. **Plugin ecosystem** - tmux has decades of plugins; Chloe is focused on core features
2. **Remote session attachment** - tmux excels at SSH workflows with `tmux attach`
3. **Scripting** - tmux has mature scripting capabilities for automation

### Basic Migration Steps

```bash
# Install Chloe
curl -fsSL https://getchloe.sh/install.sh | sh

# Start Chloe in your project
cd your-project
chloe

# Create a task (replaces tmux windows)
n         # Press 'n' to create a new task

# Split terminal (similar to tmux panes)
s         # Press 's' to split

# Navigate (same as vim)
hjkl      # Navigate between panes
```

## Use Cases Comparison

### Running Multiple AI Agents

**Chloe:** Native support. Each agent gets a pane, linked to a task, with automatic state management.

**tmux/screen:** Manual. You create windows/panes, remember which agent is where, and manage state yourself.

### Remote Server Development

**tmux/screen:** Excellent. `tmux attach` on SSH reconnect is unbeatable.

**Chloe:** Good for local-first workflows. Remote support is functional but not the primary use case.

### Pair Programming

**tmux:** Great. Multiple users can attach to the same session with `tmux -S`.

**Chloe:** Focused on individual developer workflows.

### Working on Multiple Features

**Chloe:** Excellent. Kanban board + worktrees + multiple agents = parallel feature development.

**tmux:** Good. You can achieve this with multiple windows/panes, but requires manual organization.

## The Bottom Line

### Choose Chloe if you:
- ✅ Use AI coding agents regularly (Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Amp)
- ✅ Want integrated task management
- ✅ Work with Git worktrees or Jujutsu workspaces
- ✅ Prefer simple, intuitive keybindings
- ✅ Value sensible defaults over configuration

### Choose tmux if you:
- ✅ Have an existing tmux setup you love
- ✅ Work primarily on remote servers via SSH
- ✅ Need maximum compatibility across systems
- ✅ Rely on tmux plugins and scripting

### Choose screen if you:
- ✅ Work on very old Unix systems
- ✅ Need the absolute minimum resource usage
- ✅ Are already a screen power user

## Try Chloe Risk-Free

Chloe is **free and open source** with no credit card required. You can install it alongside tmux/screen and try it for your AI coding workflows without disrupting your existing setup.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://getchloe.sh/install.sh | sh
```

Your tmux/screen configurations will remain untouched. Switch back anytime.

## FAQ

### Can I use Chloe and tmux together?

Yes! You can run Chloe inside a tmux session. This gives you tmux's remote session persistence with Chloe's AI agent features.

### Does Chloe replace tmux for all use cases?

No. Chloe is optimized for local AI coding workflows. For remote server management and SSH workflows, tmux is still the better choice.

### How is Chloe different from terminal tabs?

Terminal tabs (iTerm2, Alacritty tabs, etc.) don't provide:
- Task management and tracking
- Automatic state persistence
- AI agent detection
- Workspace awareness
- Parallel work organization

Chloe is a complete workflow manager, not just a window manager.

### Is there a performance difference?

All three tools are fast enough that you won't notice a difference in normal use. Chloe uses slightly more memory (~5MB) than tmux (~2MB) or screen (~1MB), but this is negligible on modern systems.
