# Features

## Task Management

Chloe provides a macro-level task viewer with two modes:

### Kanban Board

Track work across three columns:
- **To Do** - Tasks waiting to be started
- **In Progress** - Currently active tasks
- **Done** - Completed tasks

Press `/` to toggle between Kanban and Focus views.

### Focus View

A distraction-free list view showing tasks in a single column format.

## Interactive Instances

Run multiple terminal sessions side-by-side:

- Full PTY support for running any command
- Switch between panes with keyboard shortcuts
- Each pane runs an independent shell session
- Perfect for managing multiple Claude Code instances

## Roadmap View

Plan and visualize your project timeline:

- Add milestones and goals
- Set priorities for items
- Convert roadmap items to actionable tasks
- Generate roadmap suggestions with AI

## Worktrees

Manage git worktrees for parallel development:

- View all worktrees in your repository
- Open worktrees in your IDE
- Delete worktrees when done
- Work on multiple branches simultaneously
